		<p>In my life, I have traveled a lot and lived in many different countries. I was originally born in Gabon, then moved to Angola, followed by South Africa, and then Morocco before finally arriving in France in 9th grade. Thanks to all of these travels, I am bilingual in French and English, and I've grown fond of meeting new people and places and discovering all kinds of cultures!</p>

			<h2>A swimmer</h2>
		</div>
		<p>Ever since I was little, I always loved being in the water and swimming. From Gabon all the way to France, I've always been swimming. It's a moment of peace where I can focus on myself. I currently have 10+ years of swimming behind me, and just last year I decided to try something new.</p>

			<h2>A gym rat</h2>
		</div>
		<p>I've always been a swimmer; however, my mom and best friend have been harassing me for years to try out coming to the gym, she being a personal trainer at the gym my friend goes to. I was opposed to the idea at first, thinking it wasn't for me; however, after a year and a half of going there, it has now become my main source of exercise. It being a small gym, I get to meet lots of people and have lots of fun going there!</p>
